## About Me
* I was born in Denver, Colorado where I have lived for my entire life. I have always been interested in technology and how it works. I am a fast learner who exhibits effort in all situations.
### Strengths
- I don't give up and I am very good at working alone or with others. I am able to prioritize work and will get work done on time with outcomes exceeding expectations.
### Goals
- Currently I would like to learn more and learn to work with others. While I think my skills working with others are satisfactory, I believe I could improve further which would make the work I am able to produce much better and could be  used outside of school or work to further improve my life.

## Epic Experience

### Pi's and Python
- Through my experience in Pi's and Python I have learned to code using Python and how to utilize sensors connecting to a Raspberry pi
### Workforce Readiness
- Through the workforce readiness skills I learned to more effectively communicate my ideas with others. Also, I am better at asking clear questions and learning from others. Most importantly, I have learned not to give up when I am confused. While it may be tempting to give up I have learned to ask the right questions and work through my problems so I can reach a satisfactory outcome.
### Professional Experiences

## Projects
- Final Project - https://github.com/kobynwinn/plantcam
	- My team and I made a camera attached to a servo motor which could be viewed and controlled remotely by connecting to the IP. There was also a soil humidity sensor and a temperature sensor which displayed their data on the camera UI using HTML.
	- During this project I had to interpret code written by others on the spot and adapt my code to combine it with theirs. I learned many capabilities of HTML. My time management and teamwork skills were tested as there was a lot of work to do and everyone had different knowledge coming in to the project which was used to teach and learn from each other.
